/*
  This file contains small, atomic groups of utility styles that are
  useful for a variety of different elements across the app.
  
  These styles are applied globally. Adding one of these classes to
  an element's class list will apply the styles automatically, no
  import required.

  If you want to adjust the appearance of all occurences of a specific
  type of native element, consider adding rules to
  `@/styles/overrides.scss` instead.
  If your new utility class is becoming complex, or requires JS,
  consider making a new component in `@/components/widgets/`
  with scoped styles instead.
